## Brief History of Japan
### Bronze Age: Japan has crazy rice farms. Kings were determined by the ownership of lands and farms.
That means if you own the farm, you own a lot of food.
Which is something everybody needs to SURIVE. So that makes you the king
Rice farming and the Rice kingdom Spread across the land all the way to here.

## But the Yamato kingdom was the most important one, which was ruled by an emperor. 
And then religion was born.
The new Prince Shotoku wants everyone to try this new religion called Buddhism from Baekje
So religion took its place and all the rules that came with it.
Then government was taken by another emperor and they made some reforms like making the government govern more and making the government like the Chinas government.
And then they started calling themselves Sunrise Land (Nihon)
Year 711:
They took on the Chinese alphabet and made a book about themselves 
And then they made lots of poetry and art

After monk Kukai was born, he was bored with modern Buddhism and traveled to China to learn a new Buddhism(zen Buddhism) which is more spiritual
He comes back and reinvents the alphabet(hiragana and katakana) and causes art and literature to be great for a long time

People needed protection because their government didnâ€™t care about them.
and regular folks started hiring Samurais
Year 1000 
Everyone started hiring samurais
And then samurai became more powerful than the government 
and they made their military government(shogunate)
